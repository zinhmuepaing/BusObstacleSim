# Code Root Resolution

Shared procedure for any skill that reads, scans, counts or writes game source
files. Referenced from the point of use in each such skill. Those skills keep
the one load-bearing imperative inline — **an unresolved code root means the
check did not run** — and cite this file for the resolution order.

`.claude/docs/directory-structure.md` is the authority for which directory holds
code. This file is the procedure for applying it.

## The roots

| `engine.name` | Code root | Why it cannot be `src/` |
|---|---|---|
| Godot | `src/` | No constraint; Godot loads from `res://` anywhere under the project root |
| Unity | `Assets/` | Unity compiles **only** `Assets/` and `Packages/` |
| Unreal | `Source/<Module>/` | UnrealBuildTool discovers modules under `Source/`; content lives in `Content/` |

`src/` is the **Godot row of that table, not a universal path.**

## Resolution order

1. `engine.name` from `project.local.yaml`, then `project.yaml`.
2. The legacy mirror: an `Engine:` line in
   `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md`. A value of `[TO BE CONFIGURED]`
   does not count.
3. Derivation from the tree, but **only when it is unambiguous**. Exactly one of
   `src/`, `Assets/` or `Source/` present means that is the root. Two or more
   present means the project is genuinely undecidable — do not guess. Compare the
   names exactly as the directory listing spells them: on Windows and default
   macOS an existence test for `Assets/` also succeeds on Godot's own `assets/`,
   which would make `src/` + `assets/` look ambiguous and a lone `assets/` look
   like Unity.
4. Otherwise: **unresolved.**

The hooks already implement exactly this as `resolve_code_root()` in
`.claude/hooks/yaml-helper.sh`. Skills must match its semantics so that a hook
and a skill never disagree about where the code lives.

## Unresolved does not default to `src/`

This is the rule the whole file exists for, and it is obligation 2 of
`.claude/rules/skill-authoring.md`: an absent value may not default to the
permissive one.

**For a read or scan:** report `NOT ASSESSED — code root unresolved` and say
which check did not run. Never report zero hits.

A scan anchored to a root the project does not use matches nothing, and
**nothing is indistinguishable from a clean result.** A localization check finds
no hardcoded strings; a security scan finds no secrets; a content audit counts
no implemented content; a stage detector counts no source files and calls a
finished project greenfield. Every one of those reads as a pass. This has been
found repeatedly across skills and hooks, which is why the resolution lives in
one place now.

**For a write:** do not write. Report the unresolved root and stop.

Writing game code to the wrong root is worse than a false pass, because it
produces a project that cannot build: on Unity, source placed outside `Assets/`
is never compiled and never appears in the editor, so the work is silently
inert. Resolving the engine in order to pick a specialist agent is **not** the
same as resolving the code root — a skill can do the first correctly and still
write to the wrong directory.

## Applying it

Where a skill says `src/`, read it as *the code root* and substitute the table
above. Where a skill greps, glob the resolved root. Where a skill writes,
write under the resolved root and use the engine's own conventions beneath it
(`Assets/Scripts/<System>/` on Unity, `Source/<Module>/<System>/` on Unreal).

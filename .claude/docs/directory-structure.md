## The code root is engine-specific

**Two of the three supported engines will not build a project whose code sits in
`src/`.** This is not a style preference — it is a hard constraint of the engine's
own toolchain:

| `engine.name` | Code root | Why it cannot be `src/` |
|---|---|---|
| **Godot** | `src/` | No constraint — Godot loads from `res://` anywhere under the project root. |
| **Unity** | `Assets/` | Unity compiles **only** `Assets/` and `Packages/`. Code outside them is invisible to the compiler. |
| **Unreal** | `Source/<Module>/` | UnrealBuildTool discovers modules under `Source/`; content lives in `Content/`. A module elsewhere is not built. |

**Resolve the code root from `engine.name` before writing any source file.** A
path shown as `src/…` alone is a Godot example: read it as *"the code root"* and
substitute the row above. `src/` is the table's Godot row, not a universal path.

**Tests follow the same rule** — the same compilers decide what they see:

| `engine.name` | Test root | Anywhere else |
|---|---|---|
| **Godot** | `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` | — |
| **Unity** | `Assets/Tests/EditMode/`, `Assets/Tests/PlayMode/` | not compiled: "0 tests, Passed" |
| **Unreal** | `Source/<Module>/Private/Tests/` | not built: "No automation tests matched" |

Read `tests/unit/[system]/` (or `integration/`) anywhere as the test root plus `[System]/`.

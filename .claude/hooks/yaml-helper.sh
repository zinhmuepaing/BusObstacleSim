# Hook helper: yaml-helper.sh
# Purpose: Shared YAML reading helper for CCGS hooks and skill orchestrators.
# Cross-platform: Windows Git Bash compatible.
#
# Provides:
#   get_yaml_key <file> <dotted.path>
#     Prints the scalar value at <dotted.path> in <file>, or empty string if:
#       - the file does not exist or is unreadable
#       - the path does not exist in the YAML
#       - the path resolves to a sub-map or array (caller wanted a scalar)
#       - no Python interpreter is available
#     Always exits 0 — callers can safely use it under `set -e`.
#
#   get_yaml_array <file> <dotted.path>
#     Prints array values one per line. Handles both inline [a, b, c]
#     and block-dash forms (- a / - b on subsequent indented lines).
#     Empty output if not an array, not found, or file missing.
#
#   get_effective_yaml_key <dotted.path>
#   get_effective_yaml_array <dotted.path>
#     Convenience wrappers that read project.local.yaml first, then
#     fall back to project.yaml. Per-leaf override (local wins) —
#     sibling keys are read independently from their own files, so the
#     effective config has deep-merge semantics across leaves.
#
#   validate_yaml_enum <file>
#     Validates known enum-typed keys in <file> against their allowed
#     value sets (12 enums hardcoded below). Prints one error line per
#     invalid value to stderr. Returns 1 if any invalid value found,
#     0 otherwise. Unknown-key (typo) detection is a future sub-phase —
#     enum errors are the critical-path block per the spec.
#
#   validate_local_yaml_base
#     Hard-error guard per spec: project.local.yaml requires a project.yaml
#     base. Returns 1 with error on stderr if local exists without base.
#     Uses CWD-relative paths.
#
#   is_locally_overridable <dotted.path>
#     Whitelist check for the /settings --local flag. Returns 0 if the
#     setting is on the personal-experience whitelist (12 settings per
#     effects-map.md), 1 otherwise. Locked settings cannot be locally
#     overridden because they affect on-disk artifacts.
#
#   validate_enum_value <dotted.path> <value>
#     Single-key version of validate_yaml_enum — for /settings to check
#     a pending write before committing it to disk. Returns 0 if the
#     key has no enum constraint OR the value is in the enum set.
#     Returns 1 (with error on stderr) if the key is enum-typed and the
#     value is out of range. Skills call this before any Write/Edit.
#
#   is_always_ask_category <category>
#     Membership check on modes.automation_always_ask. Returns 0 if the
#     category is in the configured list (or in the default list when
#     unset), 1 otherwise. Skills use this in autonomous mode to know
#     when to prompt anyway. Default list: scope_changes, file_deletions,
#     schema_changes.
#
#   log_decision <skill> <point> <options> <chosen> <reason> <category>
#     Append a decision-log entry to production/session-logs/decision-log.md.
#     Creates the file and directory if absent. Used by skills in
#     autonomous mode to record decisions that would otherwise have
#     been AskUserQuestion prompts.

# Guard: project.local.yaml requires a project.yaml base.
# Per spec (effects-map.md "Creation and error handling"), the local file
# has no meaning without a base — it only overrides values from project.yaml.
# Prints a hard-error message to stderr and returns 1 if the orphan case
# is detected. Returns 0 otherwise (including when neither file exists).
# Uses CWD-relative paths — callers cd into the project root first.
# --- project root resolution -------------------------------------------------
#
# Config paths must NOT be resolved against the bare current working directory.
# Run a skill or hook from a subdirectory that way and project.yaml is
# unfindable, so EVERY setting resolves to empty -- silently, because the guard
# that reports a missing base cannot find its files either. From the repo root
# `modes.rigor` returns `full`; from `src/` it would return nothing.
#
# Being loadable from anywhere is only half the problem: the helper must also be
# able to do its job from anywhere. Fixing one without the other leaves it
# sourceable everywhere and functional only at the root.
#
# PRECEDENCE IS LOAD-BEARING, in this order:
#   1. cwd holds project.yaml         -> cwd
#   2. cwd holds project.local.yaml   -> cwd
#   3. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR has a base  -> that directory
#   4. nothing found                  -> cwd (unchanged behaviour)
#
# AN UPWARD WALK WAS IMPLEMENTED AND REMOVED, and the reason is worth keeping.
# The intent was a fallback needing no environment variable: climb until an
# ancestor has project.yaml. It resolves the wrong tree. A project that has a
# legacy production/review-mode.txt and no project.yaml, sitting anywhere below
# another project, reads the OUTER project's project.local.yaml one directory
# up instead of its own legacy file -- the wrong answer, returned silently.
#
# That is not a test-harness artifact. Any real project nested inside another
# repo that happens to carry a project.yaml would silently inherit the outer
# project's settings, which is the same silent-wrong-answer class this whole fix
# exists to remove. A fallback that guesses is worse than one that is absent:
# rule 4 leaves an unconfigured directory reading its own legacy files, which is
# exactly what a project without project.yaml should do.
#
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is populated in both the hook environment and the
# skill-bootstrap environment, so rule 3 covers every way this framework
# actually invokes the helper.
#
# 1 and 2 come FIRST deliberately. A project nested inside another one must read
# ITSELF, and an ambient CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR would otherwise point it at the
# outer tree. Rule 2 covers the case that is easiest to lose: a directory with a
# project.local.yaml and deliberately NO base must still raise the hard error
# for a missing base. Without it, an upward walk finds an ancestor's
# project.yaml and that error silently stops firing.
#
# Sets a variable rather than echoing a path: a $( ) per lookup would add a
# subshell to every one of validate_yaml_enum's 23 calls, and per-lookup cost of
# that kind is what pushes a hook past its 10s timeout.

# `testing.strict.logic: maybe` in project.local.yaml passed validation and won
# over an explicit `true` in project.yaml -- and `/story-done` treats the gate as
# BLOCKING only when the value is `true`, so a typo silently downgraded a
# blocking test gate to advisory with no error. `performance.enforce` was
# already enumerated and correctly rejected garbage, which is exactly the
# asymmetry that hides this. Any NEW boolean setting must be added here too.
#
# Two keys deliberately NOT listed as `true|false`, both of which the config
# test suite catches if they are -- add nothing here without checking it:
#   - `features.session_state` is an ON/OFF enum, not a boolean. It is listed
#     above as `on|off` because `session_state_enabled()` disables only on the
#     literal `off`, and effects-map documents `on`/`off`. Writing `false` there
#     means ENABLED, which is why validating it matters.
#   - `testing.strict` (the parent) is absent because its primary shape is a MAP
#     of the five type keys; the bare scalar is only a back-compat form. Its
#     effects-map `**Values:**` line documents the map, so enumerating the parent
#     as a scalar would force that line to misdescribe the real shape. The five
#     leaves below carry the validation, which is where /story-done reads.
#
#   validate_local_scope [<file>]
#     The location check the value checks above cannot do: names keys in
#     project.local.yaml that are NOT locally overridable, which resolution
#     silently ignores. One line per key on stderr; returns 1 if any found.
#     Warns, never reconciles. Defined below is_locally_overridable.

# Whitelist of locally-overridable settings (per effects-map.md
# "Whitelist — which settings can be locally overridden"). Personal-experience
# settings only — divergence between developers is safe because they don't

# validate_local_scope [<file>]
#   Names the keys in project.local.yaml that resolution will NEVER read,
#   because they are not on the whitelist above. One line per key on stderr;
#   returns 1 if any were found, 0 otherwise.
#
#   Why this needs its own check, separate from validate_yaml_enum: that
#   function validates VALUES, and a locked key hand-written into the local
#   file has a perfectly legal one. `modes.rigor: strict` there passes every
#   validation in the chain — correct key, correct value — and then
#   resolve_setting never consults the local file for that path, so the
#   setting is discarded in total silence and the user sees the default they
#   were trying to override. Nothing else checks the key's LOCATION.
#   /settings --local already refuses these; only the hand-edited file is
#   unguarded, and hand-editing is what the file is for.
#
#   WARNS, NEVER RECONCILES — the same shape as the stage-mirror check.
#   It does not edit project.local.yaml, does not begin honouring
#   the key, and does not alter resolution. A locked setting is locked
#   because it changes which artifacts exist on disk, so a helper that
#   "helpfully" applied one would let two developers' checkouts diverge —
#   precisely what the whitelist exists to prevent. The fix belongs to the
#   user: move the key to project.yaml, or delete it.
#
#   The parser below is a third copy of the one in get_yaml_key and
#   validate_yaml_enum. That duplication is deliberate and matches the
#   established shape of this file: these helpers are sourced individually
#   and must agree on YAML edge cases exactly, and a shared copy that drifted
#   would make two functions disagree about what a file says.

# =============================================================================
# Whole-config resolution.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   ~51 SKILL.md files each carried an English description of a deterministic
#   fallback chain ("1. If --review passed -> use that; 2. Else read
#   modes.review_mode from project.yaml; 3. Else production/review-mode.txt;
#   4. Else lean"), re-interpreted by a model on every invocation at roughly
#   +1,360 tokens per skill. resolve_config computes the same answer once, in
#   ~150 tokens, deterministically -- and testably, which prose never was.
#
# CONTRACT BOUNDARY
#   This layer resolves SOURCES. It does not own per-skill policy. Anything
#   whose default legitimately differs between skills (testing.strict.*) is
#   reported as configured-or-unset and left to the skill to default.
# =============================================================================

# Terminal defaults. ONLY knobs whose default is uniform across every consumer.
#
# testing.strict.* is deliberately ABSENT: /smoke-check defaults it to blocking
# (build-health gate) while /story-done and /dev-story default per story type.
# Emitting one value here would silently pick a winner between them.
#
# The six knobs `rigor` fronts (modes.workflow, docs.density, qa.level,
# modes.story_granularity, modes.review_mode, team.size) are ALSO absent: their
# value comes from the rigor expansion below, which sits between the legacy step
# and this table. Leaving a terminal default here as well would shadow the
# expansion and make `rigor` a no-op for anyone who had not also set the sub-knob.
# modes.review_mode is fronted by rigor so `rigor: minimal` resolves
# review_mode to `solo` (skipping the ~44k-token director/specialist gates),
# `standard` yields `lean` and `full` yields `full`. team.size joined the fronted
# set the same way: `full` yields `studio` (the whole roster) while
# `minimal`/`standard` yield `individual`. Both stay locally overridable (they
# are personal-experience knobs, not on-disk artifacts): that source sits ABOVE
# the expansion, so only the terminal fallback moved.
#
# --- WHY modes.rigor DEFAULTS TO `minimal` -----------------------------------
#
# It defaulted to `standard`. Building the same project both ways showed the
# heavier tier costing several times as much to reach working code without
# producing a better result, and giving nothing back when a fresh developer
# picked the project up. A default that costs more and does not repay is the
# wrong default, and it was what every user who never opened /settings received.
#
# Raising rigor stays one question in /start and one `/settings` call, and
# settings-guidance.md's upward triggers ("system-GDD count crosses ~9",
# "gate-check PASS into Production while rigor is minimal") are written to fire
# from exactly this starting state. The cost of under-running is one prompt.
#
# ORDER MATTERS: this default is only safe while /gate-check keeps its floors.
# `rigor: minimal` expands to `workflow: minimal` + `qa.level: minimal`, which
# together once left the Production->Polish gate with ZERO required artifacts --
# a vacuous PASS. That is fixed (the smoke-report floor and the "nothing
# required -> NOT ASSESSED, never PASS" rule). Do not move this default again
# without re-checking that the gates below it still require something.

# Rigor expansion — one asked-at-/start knob that supplies four.
#
# WHY: /start has never asked about workflow, docs.density, qa.level or
# story_granularity, so in practice every project ran all four at their defaults.
# Between them the latter three drive ONE behaviour each (prose verbosity, is-
# evidence-required, story size) restated across 19 skills with 17 "we are
# orthogonal" disclaimers. `rigor` makes the common case reachable in one
# question while each knob stays individually settable.
#
# modes.workflow is fronted, NOT replaced: it drives ~5 distinct behaviours and
# owns the only per-system override mechanism (workflow_overrides.system_
# overrides), which continues to win over the rigor-derived value.

#   source: engine.name | <legacy path> | detected | unset
#   exit:   always 0
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `.claude/docs/directory-structure.md` is explicit that the
# code root is not a style preference but a hard toolchain constraint: Unity
# compiles only `Assets/` and `Packages/`, and UnrealBuildTool discovers modules
# under `Source/`. `src/` is that table's GODOT row, not a universal path.
#
# Every hook that filtered staged or on-disk files with a literal `^src/`
# therefore matched NOTHING on a Unity or Unreal project — and matching nothing
# is indistinguishable from scanning cleanly. That is the exact row
# `.claude/rules/skill-authoring.md` records for `/security-audit`
# ("Godot-only greps returned zero hits on Unity/Unreal, and zero hits read as
# clean"), reproduced in four more places.
#
# UNSET DOES NOT DEFAULT TO `src`. Obligation 2 of skill-authoring.md: an absent
# value may not default to the permissive one. Defaulting here would re-create
# the Godot bias this function exists to remove, and would do it invisibly. An
# unresolvable root returns empty, and the CALLER must announce that its check
# did not run — see the `_no_code_root` reporting in validate-commit.sh.
#
# Step 3 (detect) is derivation, not enumeration (obligation 5): it believes the
# tree over the absence of config, but only when the tree is UNAMBIGUOUS. Two
# roots present means a genuinely undecidable project, and guessing there would
# scan half of it and report a pass.

  #      `review_mode: nonsense` resolves to the rigor value, `solo (rigor:minimal)`
  #      by default.
  #   2. No provenance. Every other line names its source; this one printed a
  #      bare value with a `${pe:+}` suffix that expands to nothing -- a
  #      provenance tag someone started and never finished. The key is on the
  #      `/settings --local` whitelist and the docs stress that a teammate's

# log: Claude Code shows that text to neither the user nor Claude. Hook JSON on
# stdout reaches both -- systemMessage is shown to the user, additionalContext
# is given to Claude next to the tool result. It sets no permissionDecision:
# "allow" would skip the user's permission prompt. stdout must hold ONLY this
# object, so call it once, as the hook's last output, then exit 0.
#
# There is no jq to lean on, so the string is escaped here: backslash and quote
# by sed, tab and newline by awk. CR and other control characters are dropped.

#
# Skills cannot `source` this file in their `` !`cmd` `` bootstrap line. Claude
# Code permission-checks every injected command before the skill renders, and
# outside auto mode anything short of "allow" ABORTS the whole invocation --
# measured on 2.1.281, see .claude/docs/config-resolution.md. A `${VAR:-x}` or
# `$( )` in the command fails that check as "Contains expansion" and no grant can
# approve it; a `source … && resolve_config` compound needs every part approved.
# `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is substituted as text before the check, so one plain
# `bash <path> resolve_config …` call is approvable by the matching grant in the
# skill's own `allowed-tools`. That is also what lets a Bash-less agent preload
# the skill.
#
# Only resolve_config is dispatchable: the bootstrap is the one caller, and
# every name added here widens what a skill grant can reach.
#
# ROOT. Run from a subdirectory, the skill shell's cwd has no project.yaml and
# $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the launch directory, not the repo root (measured), so
# rules 1-3 of _yaml_helper_set_root all miss. This file's own location is the
# one anchor that cannot drift: hooks/ sits two levels below the root. It only
# fills CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR when that has no project.yaml, so rules 1-2 (cwd
# first, for nested projects) keep their precedence.
#
# ALWAYS exits 0: a non-zero exit from an injected command aborts the skill.
